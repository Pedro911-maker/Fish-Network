# Fish-Network
Autonomous boat aiming to locate large waste areas (plastics) in order to extract them in a relevant way.

## Starting idea:

This project aims to give a fresh impulse to the treatment of the waste of our oceans, until now no measure was taken by our government in order to manage these 20 billion tons per year which are diverse in our oceans.

We must therefore become an actor of this change, that is why our project seems pragmatic and especially necessary to our global ecological plan.

This project aims to simulate a small-scale network (remote-controlled boats, immediate proximity communication, action on small areas - pools, lakes, etc.) in order to code and test a waste recognition algorithm and recovery methods.

Currently there are a number of projects that deal automatically with the recovery of waste in near-shore waters, but inefficiently in distant waters, such as SeabinV5, TrashWheel or WasteShark, as well as close to the recovery of waste off the seas and oceans such as System 001 which nevertheless require a manual operation. The goal of this project is to combine the advantages of both versions - automatic process and operation far from land shores, in the most inaccessible parts of the ocean and sea, in order to deploy an automatic network of vessels locating waste at these locations.

## Societal issues:


If our project spreads across the globe, we can reduce the amount of waste already present by at least half, while regulating new arrivals. This will allow us to clean up the coastlines, while preserving the habitat of the local populations.


## Reason to be :

According to the latest IPCC report, more than 20 billion tons of waste are dumped into the oceans. This pollution coming from 80% of the terrestrial pollution, affecting the ecosystems, is expected to continue in the coming years. The loss of natural capital caused by this pollution on fishing and tourism alone already amounts to 8 billion dollars per year.
The problem is that, apart from the financial aspect, a good third of this plastic waste, i.e. a hundred million tons, escapes any treatment (landfill, incineration, recycling) and is lost in nature. The 9/10th of this "leakage" will spread and accumulate in terrestrial ecosystems but especially in marine environments. 
By the same date and if nothing is done to prevent it, the world's seas will carry the same weight of waste as fish, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.

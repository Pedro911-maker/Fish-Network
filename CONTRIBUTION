# Introduction

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Fish Network. It's people like you that make Fish Network such a great tool.


Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

Indeed, Fish Network is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community you! 
How Can I Contribute
There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into Elasticsearch itself.

## Ground Rules
There is of course some basics rules about the respect with each others, we don't want any racist jokes or disrespectfull notes on the code developped.
Responsibilities

## Reporting Issues
We always welcome bug reports, API proposals and overall feedback. Here are a few tips on how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

## Identify Where to Report
The FishNetwork codebase is distributed across multiple repositories in the dotnet organization. Depending on the feedback you might want to file the issue on a different repo. Here are a few common repos:

Before filing a new issue, please search our open issues to check if it already exists.

If you do find an existing issue, please include your own feedback in the discussion. Do consider upvoting (üëç reaction) the original post, as this helps us prioritize popular issues in our backlog.


## Writing a Good Bug Report
Good bug reports make it easier for maintainers to verify and root cause the underlying problem. The better a bug report, the faster the problem will be resolved. Ideally, a bug report should contain the following information:

A high-level description of the problem.
A minimal reproduction, i.e. the smallest size of code/configuration required to reproduce the wrong behavior.
A description of the expected behavior, contrasted with the actual behavior observed.
Information on the environment: OS/distro, CPU arch, SDK version, etc.
Additional information, e.g. is it a regression from previous versions? are there any known workarounds?
When ready to submit a bug report, please use the Bug Report issue template.


Focus debugging efforts on a simple code snippet,
Ensure that the problem is not caused by unrelated dependencies/configuration,
Avoid the need to share production codebases.
Are Minimal Reproductions Required?
In certain cases, creating a minimal reproduction might not be practical (e.g. due to nondeterministic factors, external dependencies). In such cases you would be asked to provide as much information as possible, for example by sharing a memory dump of the failing application. If maintainers are unable to root cause the problem, they might still close the issue as not actionable. While not required, minimal reproductions are strongly encouraged and will significantly improve the chances of your issue being prioritized and fixed by the maintainers.

## How to Create a Minimal Reproduction
The best way to create a minimal reproduction is gradually removing code and dependencies from a reproducing app, until the problem no longer occurs. A good minimal reproduction:

Excludes all unnecessary types, methods, code blocks, source files, nuget dependencies and project configurations.
Contains documentation or code comments illustrating expected vs actual behavior.
If possible, avoids performing any unneeded IO or system calls. For example, can the ASP.NET based reproduction be converted to a plain old console app?
Contributing Changes
Project maintainers will merge changes that improve the product significantly and broadly align with the .NET Roadmap.

Maintainers will not merge changes that have narrowly-defined benefits, due to compatibility risk. The .NET Core codebase is used by several Microsoft products (for example, ASP.NET Core, .NET Framework 4.x, Windows Universal Apps) to enable execution of managed code. Other companies are building products on top of .NET, too. We may revert changes if they are found to be breaking.

Contributions must also satisfy the other published guidelines defined in this document.

DOs and DON'Ts
Please do:

DO follow our coding style (C# code-specific)
DO give priority to the current style of the project or file you're changing even if it diverges from the general guidelines.
DO include tests when adding new features. When fixing bugs, start with adding a test that highlights how the current behavior is broken.
DO keep the discussions focused. When a new or related topic comes up it's often better to create new issue than to side track the discussion.
DO blog and tweet (or whatever) about your contributions, frequently!
